##This repository contains three files:

"Breast_Cancer.csv": the dataset used in the dashboard.
"breast_cancer.pbix": the Power BI file containing the dashboard visualization.

##Power BI Dashboard
The "breast_cancer.pbix" file contains a Power BI dashboard that displays information about breast cancer patients. The dashboard includes the following elements:

Cue card: this card displays the total number of patients in the dataset, as well as the number of patients with benign and malignant tumors.
Donut chart: this chart shows the percentage of patients with cancer (positive) and without cancer (negative).
Area chart: this chart displays the distribution of patients by age.
Navigation bar: this bar appears on the left side of the dashboard and contains dropdown menus for View, Birads, Invasive, Machine ID, Density, and Difficult Case.
Slicers: there are three slicers at the bottom of the dashboard that allow users to filter the data by biopsy, age, and biopsy.

##Dataset
The dataset used in this dashboard is "Breast_Cancer.csv". It contains information about breast cancer patients, including their age, biopsy results, and tumor classification.

How to use
To use the Power BI dashboard, download the "breast_cancer.pbix" file and open it in Power BI Desktop. You will need to have Power BI Desktop installed on your computer to open the file.

Once the file is open, you can interact with the dashboard by selecting different options in the navigation bar and using the slicers to filter the data.
